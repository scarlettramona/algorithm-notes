Two Pointer approach for finding the middle of a list:

turtle: default iterator, moves only one step at a time
hare: moves two steps at once

turtle is in the middle when hare reaches the end


Given a list, is it cycled or not?

With the two pointer approach, 
- if tortoise and hare start at the same point
- then after some iterations they will face each other exactly at the point where they started
